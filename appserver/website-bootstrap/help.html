                <h1>About Twitter Trends</h1>
                <p>Twitter Trends is a web application that allows users to visualize and explore pertinent topics
                    on the social media platform Twitter. The user can access an interface that offers options of
                    fun and interactive visualizations and can switch between these views, including Locations, Time,
                    and Network. When chosen, each view will present real time Twitter data with the focus on different
                    aspects. The user does not need their own Twitter account to use this product; however, they have
                    the option to input their Twitter account name to connect the application to their own account.
                    With this, they can view more personalized data, such as data only including their network of
                    followers that is located within the Network Pages.</p>

                <h2>Helpful Tips:</h2>

                <h3>Locations</h3>
                <p>Analyzing the Map Visualization: The Map page displays a map of the United States with markers 
					on major cities. When clicked on, the page will display trends from that location. Click on a 
					trend to see more information about it on the right hand side. You can also view U.S. and world
					trends. You can zoom in on an individual U.S. state by clicking on it. Clicking again will zoom 
					back out to the whole map. Once zoomed in, choose a socioeconomic variable from the dropdown list 
					to see a colormap of that state.</p>

                <h3>Time</h3>
                <p>Analyzing Trends Over Time: On the Time page you can add different trending hashtags
                    using the selection pane on the right side of the screen. You may add up to five different trends. 
					Note - when you remove trends, they are removed bottom to top. You can also select a given time 
					interval in Days. Clicking update will update the graph and reveal the visualization. To specify a 
					location you would like to analyze, begin typing the name into the search bar, then choose from the 
					list it provides.</p>

                <h3>Network</h3>
                <p>Analyzing a User's Network: The Network page analyzes a given user's network and displays a network
					graph containing other accounts that retweet said user most often. Input a user and select the number 
					of nodes to be shown, then click Update Graph. It may take a few seconds to update, be patient. 
					Once updated, hover over nodes to see more information about them.</p>

                <h3>Word Cloud</h3>
                <p>Analyzing the Word Cloud: The Word Cloud page analyzes a given user's network for trending keywords
                    and topics. Enter a user's Twitter account, select the number of accounts that you wish to search
                    within that user's network, and click Update Graph. It may take a few seconds to update, patience is 
					a virtue. The output will be a colorful word cloud containing keywords and topics from the user and 
					their network.</p>

                <h3>Tweets/Trends</h3>
                <p>Analyzing the Tweets/Trends Exploration: On this page, there are multiple ways to analyze tweets and 
					trends. The first finds trends by location. Just begin entering a city name, choose from the list 
					provided, and hit Search. This will yield a list of the top current trends in the city. The second is 
					an easy way to find tweets containing a topic of your choosing. Enter a keyword, hit Search, and see 
					recent tweets containing that word. The last way to analyze trends is over time in a tabular format. 
					Choose a start date, an end date, and a city if you so wish, then click Search. The page will output 
					trends from that time period. If you choose not to input dates, the page will return trends from the 
					past 12 hours.
					</p>

				<h3>Navigation</h3>
				<p>While you can navigate the pages using the Analyze dropdown in the upper right corner of each page,
					clicking on the Twitter Trends logo will always return you to the Locations analysis page with the map.</p>
